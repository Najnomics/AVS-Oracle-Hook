# AVS Oracle Hook Documentation

## Overview

The AVS Oracle Hook is a decentralized price validation system that integrates EigenLayer's Actively Validated Services (AVS) with Uniswap V4's hook mechanism. It provides real-time price manipulation detection and consensus-based validation to protect users from malicious price manipulation attacks.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Price Validation**: Validates swap prices against AVS operator consensus before execution
- **Manipulation Detection**: Advanced algorithms detect and prevent price manipulation attempts
- **Stake-weighted Consensus**: Uses operator stake amounts to weight price attestations
- **Multi-source Validation**: Aggregates prices from multiple sources (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken)
- **Configurable Parameters**: Pool-specific oracle settings and thresholds
- **Economic Security**: Slashing mechanism for malicious operators

### Quick Start

#### For Developers
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/avs-oracle-hook
cd avs-oracle-hook

# Install dependencies
forge install

# Build contracts
forge build

# Run tests
forge test
```

#### For Operators
```bash
# Build operator binary
cd avs && go build -o bin/operator cmd/main.go

# Configure operator
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml with your settings

# Register with AVS
./bin/operator register --config config.yaml

# Start operating
./bin/operator start --config config.yaml
```

#### For Pool Creators
```solidity
// Deploy pool with Oracle Hook
PoolKey memory poolKey = PoolKey({
    currency0: Currency.wrap(USDC),
    currency1: Currency.wrap(WETH),
    fee: 3000,
    tickSpacing: 60,
    hooks: IHooks(ORACLE_HOOK_ADDRESS)
});

// Initialize pool (oracle auto-configured for major pairs)
poolManager.initialize(poolKey, SQRT_PRICE_1_1, "");
```

## System Components

### Smart Contracts
- **AVSOracleHook**: Main Uniswap V4 hook for price validation
- **OracleServiceManager**: EigenLayer AVS service manager
- **OracleTaskHook**: L2 task coordination hook
- **PriceValidation**: Price validation algorithms library
- **ConsensusCalculation**: Consensus calculation library

### Infrastructure
- **Go Operator**: Price attestation and consensus participation
- **Price Aggregation**: Multi-source price data collection
- **Monitoring Stack**: Health monitoring and alerting
- **API Services**: REST and WebSocket APIs for external access

## Security Model

### Economic Security
- **Minimum Stake Requirements**: Operators must stake ETH to participate
- **Slashing Conditions**: Penalties for providing false price data
- **Reward Distribution**: Incentives for accurate price reporting

### Technical Security
- **Multi-source Validation**: Cross-validation across multiple price feeds
- **Outlier Detection**: Statistical analysis to identify anomalous prices
- **Consensus Thresholds**: Minimum agreement levels required
- **Temporal Validation**: Time-based staleness checks

### Operational Security
- **Monitoring**: Real-time system health monitoring
- **Alerting**: Automated alerts for system anomalies
- **Emergency Procedures**: Incident response protocols
- **Governance**: Decentralized parameter management
