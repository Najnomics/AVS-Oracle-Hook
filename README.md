# AVS-Oracle-Hook
AVS Oracle Hook is a Uniswap V4 hook that integrates with an EigenLayer AVS to provide real-time price validation for swaps. The system replaces traditional oracle networks with restaked ETH validators who submit price attestations backed by slashing conditions, creating superior security and manipulation resistance for DeFi price feeds.
